⚠️ BY DECREE OF THE CHAOTIC ORDER OF THE HAND_WAVE_TRANSLATOR_9000 ⚠️

Let this scroll serve as divine warning:  
This code — forged in caffeine and frustration — is the rightful creation of one Abraham Kuruvila, known also as “Kuruvi,” wielder of git and GPU.

— TO THE WANDERERS OF GITHUB —

— TO THE PLAGIARIZING SCUM WHO SEEK TO PROFIT WITHOUT PERMISSION —

If thou takest this work and dares to sell it without mine blessing…

**KNOW YE THIS:**

Your punishment shall be crafted from the annals of the darkest corners of human history:

- 🔥 May you be stuffed into the *Brazen Bull*, where your cries echo as song to the gods of piracy.  
- 🪢 Stretched upon the *Torture Rack* until your spinal alignment resembles your git history.  
- ⛓ Shackled in the *Stocks*, mocked endlessly by StackOverflow moderators.  
- 🌊 *Waterboarded* with endless memory leaks and NULL pointer dereferences.  
- 🐎 Ripped asunder by *four wild horses*, each one named after a deprecated Python package.  
- ⚰ Buried alive in an avalanche of unsorted JSON files.

And may your IDE forever default to light mode.  
With Comic Sans.  
And *auto-save disabled*.

— TO THE HONORABLE —

If you just forked this for fun, wanted to mess with Mediapipe, or maybe you vibed with the chaos — go forth.  
You good. No torture for you. Unless you push to `main` without testing, you absolute animal.
