Like the name suggests... this is a Sign Language project I’m working on.

It started as a school project, but like all beautiful disasters, it spiraled out of control.  
Impatient teachers? Yeah, I private’d the repo they had access to, claimed it was a failure, and ghosted.  
Now, a few months later (just long enough for plausible deniability, muehehehe), I’ve made a new repo.  
Same logic, more refactored, and this time… hopefully complete. Unlike last time. 💀
